# DataFest-2017-Best-Insight-Winner
Winning R-code for UCLA's annual DataFest competition. Out of 150 teams that applied, 60 who participate and 12 finalists selected, our teams presentation was awarded "Best Insight".

Our approach involved looking at surface level observations for many hours until finding a truly valuable difference in variables that could lead to a huge revenue increase for the company's data. What set us apart was our patience and willingess to use trial and error before diving too deep into any one insight.

Out of my 400 lines of R-code used to compare potentially important variables here are the 80 lines of code that actually developed usable metrics and variables to be applied to our insight.
